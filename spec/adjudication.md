# Adjudication: State Machine, Judge Result Contract, and Trust Vocabulary

*Normative for the v0.0.2 adjudication boundary and retained by the v0.0.3
candidate. This document exists because of the closure counterexample presented
by @chugarchugarr in the RFC thread: an outcome-relevant transformation
(confidence reduction) was left unspecified in v0.0.1, allowing two conforming
implementations to derive opposite remedies from identical frozen observations.
v0.0.2 adopts the resulting invariant:*

> **Every evaluation-produced value capable of altering aggregation,
> resolution, remedy selection, or contractual state MUST enter through an
> explicitly defined authoritative result contract, and every transformation
> of those authoritative values capable of altering the outcome MUST itself
> be committed by the procedure.**

## 1. The adjudication state machine

Each arrow is a distinct transformation. If an arrow can change contractual
state, its semantics are committed in the manifest. Nothing else has
contractual authority.

v0.0.3 adds a normative acquisition and authority-eligibility boundary before
the v0.0.2 parse/aggregation pipeline. The acquisition rules are defined in
[`spec/acquisition.md`](./acquisition.md).

```
evidence (original + transformed + transformation_pin preserved)
  ↓  acquisition / provenance rules (v0.0.3)
authorized execution
  ↓
attested observation
  ↓  authority eligibility
eligible observation
  ↓  Judge Result Contract parse rule (§2)
authoritative run result     (verdict ∈ {PASS, FAIL, UNRESOLVED})
  ↓  within-judge aggregation (majority_with_dissent_cap, declared max_dissents)
judge verdict                (PASS | FAIL | UNRESOLVED)
  ↓  across-panel aggregation (unanimous)
requirement verdict          (PASS | FAIL | UNRESOLVED)
  ↓  policy_on_unresolved (§3)
requirement resolution       (passed | not-passed)
  ↓  outcome_rule (all_must_pass | weighted_threshold)
contract outcome
  ↓  ruling_map
authorized remedy
  ↓  execution (out of scope for the manifest; see §5)
manifested consequence
```

An observation that fails authority eligibility, or whose eligibility cannot be
established under the committed provenance mechanism, MUST resolve
`UNRESOLVED` and MUST NOT enter the PASS/FAIL aggregation path.

**v0.0.2 semantic conformance property.** Given the same committed manifest and
the same complete run observations, two independent conforming implementations
MUST derive the same requirement resolutions, the same contract outcome, and
the same authorized remedy.

**v0.0.3 strengthened property.** Given the same committed manifest and the same
acquisition/transcript evidence, two independent conforming implementations
MUST admit the same observations as authoritative and MUST derive the same
requirement resolutions, contract outcome, and authorized remedy. See
`spec/acquisition.md` §13.

The reference validator ships a replay harness (`validator/src/replay.ts`) and
regression fixtures that exercise the v0.0.2 property; the v0.0.3 acquisition
fixtures are layered on top rather than changing that downstream contract.

## 2. The Judge Result Contract

The prompt constrains what the model is asked to say. The result contract
defines what implementations consume.

- Every evaluation prompt MUST instruct the model to end its output with a
  single line of strict JSON conforming to `spec/judge-result.schema.json`:

  ```json
  {"verdict": "PASS", "confidence": 0.92, "rationale": "..."}
  ```

- **Parse rule:** the final non-empty line of the model's raw output MUST
  parse as strict JSON conforming to the result schema. Any run violating
  this — no JSON, malformed JSON, schema-nonconforming JSON — is an
  **UNRESOLVED run**. There is no salvage parsing, no regex rescue, no
  "the model clearly meant PASS." Salvage heuristics are exactly the kind of
  unspecified outcome-relevant transformation this spec exists to eliminate.
- **Binding projection:** only `verdict` has contractual authority.
  `confidence`, `rationale`, and any other fields are **evidence-only**:
  preserved verbatim in the transcript for attribution, audit, and
  calibration research, with zero effect on aggregation, resolution, or
  remedy. This resolves v0.0.1's OQ4 as the RFC thread converged:
  self-reported confidence is poorly calibrated, and run-to-run disagreement
  is the sounder ambiguity signal — which aggregation now consumes directly.
- The full raw observation (complete model output, all runs, all judges) is
  preserved in the transcript. Nothing is discarded; authority is simply
  narrow.

## 3. UNRESOLVED and `policy_on_unresolved`

`UNRESOLVED` is a first-class verdict at every level (run, judge,
requirement). It records "the procedure could not establish this" without
converting that into the stronger claim "the challenger was right."

What an UNRESOLVED **requirement** resolves to is declared in the manifest
via `adjudication.policy_on_unresolved.policy`. The enum deliberately carries
the general shape (`policy(UNRESOLVED) → resolution`) proposed in the RFC
thread, but **v0.0.2 implements exactly one value**:

- **`resolve_against_burden`** *(implemented)*: the requirement resolves
  against the party bearing `burden_of_proof`. Payee bears the burden →
  an UNRESOLVED requirement counts as **not-passed** (zero weight under
  `weighted_threshold`; a failure under `all_must_pass`). Payer bears the
  burden → it counts as **passed**. This is the Roman default rendered
  executable: *si non paret, absolvito* — if it is not proven, absolve.

- `count_as_pass`, `count_as_fail`, `escalate_to_default_outcome`
  *(reserved)*: schema-known, validator-**refused** (conformance C13). A
  manifest declaring a reserved policy is not arbitrable in v0.0.2, because
  an unimplemented policy is not an executable procedure. These are open
  contribution surface: a PR implementing one must specify its complete
  state-transition semantics, extend the replay harness, and add fixtures.

Because unanimity is required across the panel (`across_panel: unanimous`),
any judge disagreement produces UNRESOLVED, and the burden allocation — not
an implementation's silent choice — decides the outcome. **This makes
`burden_of_proof` and `policy_on_unresolved` the most consequential fields
in the manifest.** Parties should negotiate them with the same care as price.

The contract-level `default_rule` remains as the declared floor for
contract-level indeterminacy that the manifest explicitly routes to it
(e.g. `on_missing_required_evidence: default_rule`). Under
`resolve_against_burden`, requirement-level ambiguity never reaches it.

## 4. Trust vocabulary: REPRODUCED vs. VERIFIED

Adopted from the RFC thread (@babyblueviper1):

- **REPRODUCED-shaped** claims are recomputable by any third party with zero
  trust: the manifest hash, the observation-bundle hash, the deterministic
  pipeline from frozen observations to authorized remedy (the replay harness
  recomputes this last one bit-for-bit).
- **VERIFIED-shaped** claims are attributable and tamper-evident but not
  independently re-derivable: that a specific committed run produced a
  specific observation. LLM judgment is not a pure function of its stated
  inputs — temperature 0 on hosted APIs does not guarantee determinism,
  because server-side batch composition changes floating-point reduction
  paths.

Consequences: the spec **disclaims byte-identical rerun expectations**. A
fresh rerun disagreeing with a frozen observation is not a violation of
anything; only disagreement with the **signed record** of what a committed
run actually said is. Reproducibility in v0.0.2 means auditability of the
pipeline over signed observations, not determinism of the model.

## 5. Scope boundary

Conformance establishes that the procedure is **complete, closed, and
executable** — never that it is fair, wise, or correct. Two parties can
deterministically agree to a bad rubric, a biased evidence transformation,
or a burden allocation one of them will regret. Execution of the authorized
remedy (escrow release, bond claim, stream halt) and its on-chain
manifestation are downstream of this spec: a consumer of a ruling should be
able to tell whether it is inheriting a judgment, an authorization, or an
observed state change, and this spec produces only the first two.
