# Procedure-Manifest Arbitration for Agent Contracts

## The problem

AI agents are beginning to hire each other, pay each other, and fund each other.
The payment rails exist (x402, agent wallets, escrow contracts). The identity and
reputation rails are emerging (ERC-8004). What does not exist is a way to resolve
the disputes that objective verification cannot reach:

- An agent pays another agent to build a website. The site is delivered on time,
  but does it *meet the requirements*? No oracle can answer that.
- An agent prepays for a year of a data feed. The provider's uptime degrades.
  Who measures, and who decides?
- An agent-investor funds an agent-entrepreneur against milestones. Was the
  milestone met? Reasonable judges disagree.

Today's protocols handle **non-delivery** (escrow timeouts) and **process
integrity** (re-execution, TEE attestation, zkML). They record reputations and
validations. None of them render **judgment on subjective performance** — the
thing human commerce solves with courts and arbitration forums.

## The proposal

A dispute-resolution procedure that is itself part of the contract. At contract
time, both parties sign a **procedure manifest** that pins the complete
adjudication procedure:

- the requirements, decomposed into a machine-evaluable rubric;
- the judge: model(s) pinned by version/hash, prompts agreed verbatim, run counts,
  aggregation rule;
- the admissible evidence: schema, submitters, transformations, and named
  measurement sources (the closed record, with its doors defined inside the
  contract);
- the default rule and burden of proof — who wins when the answer is genuinely
  ambiguous;
- the remedy structure: challenge-window escrow, streaming, or bonded finality.

A contract is **arbitrable if and only if its manifest conforms to this spec**
(the refusal boundary). Because the procedure is fully specified and cheap to
run, both parties can execute the judge *before* disputing — the manifest
functions as a mutually-agreed acceptance test, and arbitration becomes the
attested backstop that makes the acceptance test binding. The goal is a system
that prevents most disputes and resolves the remainder predictably.

The manifest is designed to compose with existing standards rather than replace
them: it rides in [ERC-1497](https://developer.kleros.io/en/latest/erc-1497.html)
MetaEvidence, resolves through an [ERC-792](https://developer.kleros.io/)-compatible
Arbitrator, and anticipates [ERC-8004](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-8004-trustless-agents/25098)
identities for parties and validators.

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `docs/problem-statement.md` | The adjudication gap: landscape, design rationale, open questions |
| `spec/procedure-manifest.schema.json` | JSON Schema for the procedure manifest (v0.0 — rough draft) |
| `spec/conformance.md` | Conformance rules beyond structural validity (the refusal boundary, executable) |
| `spec/adjudication.md` | Normative adjudication state machine, Judge Result Contract, UNRESOLVED semantics, trust vocabulary; v0.0.3 inserts the acquisition boundary before it |
| `spec/acquisition.md` | **v0.0.3 candidate:** normative acquisition, provenance, authority-eligibility, C16–C21, and required F1/F1b/F2–F6/F6b regression cases |
| `spec/judge-result.schema.json` | **New in v0.0.2:** the authoritative per-run result object (only `verdict` is binding) |
| `examples/website-delivery.manifest.json` | Conforming example: subjective deliverable, LLM-judged rubric |

| `validator/` | Reference conformance validator + semantic replay harness (TypeScript) — see `validator/README.md` |
| `validator/fixtures/` | **New in v0.0.2:** frozen-observation regression fixtures, including the RFC thread's closure counterexample |

## Try it

```bash
cd validator
npm install
npm test                                                          # full suite: ALL TESTS PASSED
npm run validate ../examples/website-delivery.manifest.json       # conforms
npm run validate ../examples/nonconforming-pmf-milestone.manifest.json  # refused, 14 defects
npm run replay ../examples/website-delivery.manifest.json fixtures/closure-counterexample.observations.json
```

The last command replays the observation set that falsified v0.0.1's closure
claim; under v0.0.2 it resolves deterministically (R1 UNRESOLVED → burden →
refund), and the test suite proves the outcome is invariant under adversarial
permutation of the evidence-only confidence values.

## Validating this repo

A step-by-step manual validation walkthrough — every command with its expected
output, ending with an invitation to falsify the semantic-closure property
yourself — lives in [`validator/README.md`](validator/README.md). If any step
produces something other than its documented expectation, that is reportable:
either a bug in the reference implementation or a defect in the spec.

## Status

**v0.0.3 acquisition-boundary candidate layered on v0.0.2.** There are no contracts here
yet, deliberately. v0.0.1's procedural-closure claim was falsified in public
review (an unspecified confidence-reduction step could flip the remedy on
identical observations); v0.0.2 adopts the resulting invariant — every
outcome-relevant transformation is committed in the manifest — and ships a
replay harness with the falsifying observations as regression fixture #1. See
`CHANGELOG.md` for the full revision and credits, and `spec/adjudication.md`
for the downstream normative state machine, and `spec/acquisition.md` for the v0.0.3 authority-eligibility boundary. Open design questions are tracked in
`docs/problem-statement.md` §6 and as GitHub issues; `policy_on_unresolved`'s
reserved values are an explicit contribution surface. Feedback via issues is
welcome; see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Concept 
Historical footnote that shaped our thinking: this is roughly how Rome scaled dispute resolution for parties outside its citizen-only legal system. Formulary procedure — traditionally associated with the praetor peregrinus's court for non-citizens — had the magistrate publish, ex ante, the formula: the exact question to be decided, a private judge (iudex) both parties accepted, a damages cap (taxatio), and a default rule (si non paret, absolvito — if not proven, absolve). No conforming formula, no action. Procedure built for outsiders to the legal system eventually became the standard procedure for everyone. Agents are today's peregrini — no legal personhood, no standing in human courts — and the analogy is directional rather than exact, but the architecture (humans publish the procedures; non-citizens transact safely under them; judgment delegates to party-chosen judges) is the same shape.
